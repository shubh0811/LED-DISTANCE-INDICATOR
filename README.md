# LED-DISTANCE-INDICATOR

#### Hi, Shubh this side, I am here to give a bit of description about the project that i made.

![Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79529647/119790780-0cd4c600-be89-11eb-9bc9-00fc480c5582.jpg)

#### As you could see in this image the Arduino UNO is connected to the Ultrasonic Sensor as well as Bread Board.
#### Arduino's Digital pins are connected to the Bread board(LED's as well as resistors).
#### Arduino's GND is connected to the Breadboard .
#### Arduino's power pin and GND is Connected to the VCC and GND of the Ultrasonic sensor.
#### Ultrasonic's trig and echo is connected to the didgital pins of the Arduino board.
